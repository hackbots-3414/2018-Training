This trivial Robot.java can be used with an XBox gamepad.  The two joysticks are the 
left and right tank drive controllers.  

Launch frcsim with:
	frcsim ~/wpilib/simulation/worlds/3414_simple_world.world
	
This will bring up a 2017 field with a skeletal 6-wheel drivetrain.  Careful - those 
motors have a lot of torque.
